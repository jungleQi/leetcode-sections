A common strategy for tree modification problems is recursion.
A tree is a recursive structure

when it comes to problems where the structure of the tree has to
be modified or we have to traverse the tree in general, recursion
is one of the top approaches that comes to mind simply because
it's easy enough to code up and also is very intuitive to understand
